_The transformation of a meagre entryway amongst amidst macabre memory of the Roman practises into a grand portal surrounded by the idyllic gardens of Roman aristocracy._


# Setting the Scene

Porta Esquilina, or the Esquiline Gate, once stood where the Gallienus Arch can now be seen (Figure 1). It was positioned in the eastern portion of the Servian wall on the southern end of the Rome’s artificial defense mechanism, the agger (Dionys. IX.68, figure 2). As it currently stands in modern Italy, the grand single archway that remains of the gate is tucked away among the quiet townscape only really catching the attention of those who happen to be passing by. Almost 2,400 years ago, when only a small entry way that was Porta Esquilina existed, however, it would have equated to something more like a modern highway, with it marking one of the busiest entrances into the great city of Rome.




# Death, the Necropolis and the Esquiline gate

The grave yard of the common folk and a general dumping ground being no more than 100 metres from the entry way. Near to the gate was a shrine to goddess of funerals Libertina. Adding to the grimness of this area, public executions were commonly performed near the entrance to the. To top it all off, the agger would act as a mass burial site in the event of increased mortality rates. It seems this combination of macabre memories across the landscape through the Esquiline gate was the cause for the eventual transformation of the graveyard to luscious gardens (horti) under the instruction of Augustus’ political advisor, Maecenas.

# Traffic through the gate

Whether on purpose or not, the Esquiline gate was positioned in a very geographically strategic position. The flood plains, rivers and plateaus of the landscape forced any traffic coming towards to the city from the direction of the gate to be funneled towards its direction. Furthermore, a large amount of produce generated near the gate was comprised of perishable goods. As a result, the best choice for producers within this economic field was to conduct their trade and sales at the market place just within the Esquiline gate.

The gate would have also experienced increased foot traffic in comparison to the others of the Servian wall as FORUM OR CAMPUS within the gate to frequent markets referred to as the Nundinae. This market was used for trades of all sorts, from produce to household necessities to clothing.

In fact, it is due to the massive volume of traffic that the gate was to be pulled down and reconstructed in 262B, which still exists in physical remains of the city peppered throughout
