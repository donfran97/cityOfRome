_The transformation of a meagre entryway amongst amidst macabre memory of the Roman practises into a grand portal surrounded by the idyllic gardens of Roman aristocracy._


# Setting the Scene

Porta Esquilina, or the Esquiline Gate, once stood where the Gallienus Arch can now be seen (Figure 1). It was positioned in the eastern portion of the Servian wall on the southern end of the Rome’s artificial defense mechanism, the _agger_ (Dionys. IX.68, Figure 1). As it currently stands in modern Italy, the grand single archway that remains of the gate is tucked away among the quiet townscape only really catching the attention of those who happen to be passing by. Almost 2,400 years ago, when only a small entry way that was Porta Esquilina existed, however, it would have equated to something more like a modern highway, with it marking one of the busiest entrances into the great city of Rome.

# A Gate of the Servian Wall

Porta Esquilina was one of 16 gates built into the Servian wall, the remains of which are peppered throughout modern Italy. The wall gets its name from Servius Tullius, the sixth king of Rome, who was originally believed to have constructed the wall. Despite the date of construction being contested, potentially pushing the date forward as early as the 4th century B.C.E., the name has stuck (Ross). The Esquiline portion of the wall is constructed of _tufa_ originating from the _Grotta Oscura_ quarry, a mine approximately 15 km from the city (Ross, 1996, Lynne, C, 2005). From this information it can has been concluded the original Esquiline Gate would have been comprised of the same _tufa_.

# Traffic through the gate

Whether on purpose or not, the Esquiline gate was positioned in a very economically strategic position (Urban Development). The flood plains, rivers and plateaus of the landscape forced any traffic coming towards to the city from the direction of the gate to be funneled towards its direction. Furthermore, a large amount of produce generated near the gate was comprised of perishable goods. As a result, the best choice for producers within this economic field was to conduct their business at the market place just within the Esquiline gate. The gate would have also experienced increased foot traffic in comparison to the others of the Servian wall as the forum just within the gate to frequently hosted markets referred to as the _nundinae_. This market was used for trades of all sorts, from produce to household necessities to clothing. This combination of factors resulted in the gate becoming one of the busiest points of movement along the Servian Wall.

# Renovating the Gates of Rome

In fact, it was due to the massive influx of traffic over time that the gate was to eventually be pulled down and reconstructed as a triple-arch in the first century B.C.E (Holland, 1946)(Figure 3). The original gate would have only accommodated for single lane traffic as it was only constructed to be 3 metres wide which couldn’t account for the massive increase in traffic the gate saw as the economy grew. The new _travertine_ gate therefore was designed with three portals rather than a single one which was spanned just over 7 metres wide (Urban development). According to Holland (1946) the replaced arch is a rather unique triple arch as it does not conform to the common structure found across the rest of Europe. Normally the arch ways would be set equally in a lateral direction, though in the case of this new gate the side portals were staggered equally backwards from the larger central arch. It is through this unconformity that the arch can be approximately dated to the Augustan era reconstruction program which saw to reconstruct Rome’s busiest portals into the city (Urban development article). In 262 A.D. the gate was altered and rededicated to the emperor Gallienus and his wife, evident from the inscription which remains upon the arch (Holland). Despite the gate standing with only one of the three entry ways remaining, passing through the grand archway of Porta Esquilina today invokes the memory of the grand city of Rome to which it once led (Figure 2).

# Evolution of the Esquiline Region

The graveyard of the common folk and a general dumping ground being no more than 100 metres from the entry way. Near to the gate was a shrine to goddess of funerals Libertina. Adding to the grimness of this area, public executions were commonly performed near the entrance to the. To top it all off, the agger would act as a mass burial site in the event of increased mortality rates. It seems this combination of macabre memories across the landscape through the Esquiline gate became inspiration for the advisor of Augustus, Maecenas, to renew the scenery with the addition of gardens (horti) to his estate in the area (Platner and Ashby)(Figure 3). This new found fresh image that was being presented with the introduction of Maecenas’ gardens to the area around the gate encouraged other nobilities to follow suite (Urban Development). Thus, the once morbid Esquiline scenery was transformed into a tranquil landscape.
