Porta Collina Draft

Porta Collina or the Colline Gate was a major Roman gate in the Servian Walls. As part of the Servian Walls, the gate was supposedly built by Servius Tullius who was king of Rome in 578-535BC. It was originally called Agonensis but was renamed taking its name from the Regio Collina, one of the four regions of republican Rome made up of the Collis Quirinalis and Collis Viminalis.

# History

Though not much information is displayed on the whereabouts or its composition, it has been featured in numerous major events, the most notable being the battle fought between Lucius Cornelius Sulla and the Marians in 83BC, during a period of civil war. Sulla as dictator had to regain control of Rome after Gaius Marius and his son supported by Lucius Cornelius Cinna took control of Rome and killed Sulla’s supporters, with Sulla marching on Rome with his armies. The gate was also one that the Romans had most often to defend, against combined armies of Veientes and Fidenates Etruscans (Livy 4.21.8), the gate that the Gauls entered the city in 387BC (Livy 5.41.4) and the gate that Hannibal had camped beyond in the Second Punic War (Pliny 15.20.3). The gate was a result was designed to accommodate for a strong defence with trenches, constant repair ands strengthening and planted engines to make way for artillery.

# Location

Limited information on the Colline Gate’s location points to the north end of the agger (ramparts), as well as being the place where the Via Salaria and Via Nomentana roads diverged, the Via Salaria going due north and Via Nomentana northeast

# Modern Reports

Remains of the gate were found in 1872 in the Via Venti Settembre under the north-east corner of the Ministero delle Finanze, in a second period two great square bastions with facings of peperino had been added to the fortifications just in front of the gate. From archaeological reports on other sections of the Servian Wall, the material was deduced to be “tufa” (also named “tufo” or “tuff”), a light, porous rock formed by consolidation of volcanic ash that enabled concrete construction in masonry, which likely would have come from the Grotta Oscura quarries in Veii or the Aventine. Travertine, a sedimentary form of limestone was also discussed to have been used as building materials.
