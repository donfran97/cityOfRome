Porta Esquilina - Draft

The Porta Esquilina once stood where the Gallienus Arch can now be seen, positioned in the eastern region of the Servian wall on the southern end of the Romes artificial defense mechanism, known as the agger. As it stands in modern Italy, the gate blends with the quiet townscape and may even be considered unassuming. In the distant past when the original gate was only 2 metres wide, however, it would have equated to something more like a modern highway, with it marking the entrance to the great City of Rome. Fascinating to the thing that passing through such an entrance would have been nothing more than daily or weekly routine to the average Roman and perhaps have been associated with a certain somberness.

# Death, the Necropolis and the Esquiline gate

The grave yard of the common folk and a general dumping ground being no more than 100 metres from the entry way. Near to the gate was a shrine to goddess of funerals Libertina. Adding to the grimness of this area, public executions were commonly performed near the entrance to the. To top it all off, the agger would act as a mass burial site in the event of increased mortality rates. It seems this combination of macabre memories across the landscape through the Esquiline gate was the cause for the eventual transformation of the graveyard to luscious gardens (horti) under the instruction of Augustus’ political advisor, Maecenas.

# Traffic through the gate

Whether on purpose or not, the Esquiline gate was positioned in a very geographically strategic position. The flood plains, rivers and plateaus of the landscape forced any traffic coming towards to the city from the direction of the gate to be funneled towards its direction. Furthermore, a large amount of produce generated near the gate was comprised of perishable goods. As a result, the best choice for producers within this economic field was to conduct their trade and sales at the market place just within the Esquiline gate.

The gate would have also experienced increased foot traffic in comparison to the others of the Servian wall as FORUM OR CAMPUS within the gate to frequent markets referred to as the Nundinae. This market was used for trades of all sorts, from produce to household necessities to clothing.

In fact, it is due to the massive volume of traffic that the gate was to be pulled down and reconstructed in 262B, which still exists in physical remains of the city peppered throughout
