[Try to force a laugh here, idiot]. \n\nHow predictable, never thinking about stepping into a trap, never thinking about rushing ahead, NEVER THINKING ABOUT THOSE WHO YOU LEAD. Did you even bother to talk to them before you set out? \n\nDid you wonder why so many \"loyalists\" stayed with you? Who were they loyal to? Alice, you were a fool. (Shout this last bit). You are no leader. You are a grunt, charging ahead without thinking. You are no leader, you rush from fiasco to fiasco. \n\nYou are no leader, you are a pretender to the name of Alice.  Everything is turning out the way I planned. I allowed you to charge into this trap as my soldiers \"ran away\" from the fortress door, doing amazingly few \"casualties.\" \n\nDid you ever think that they were not aiming at their comrades? And shooting to miss you? You are here, alone. You pathetic excuse for a grunt. You have fallen into my power and I see you struggling against the grasp of those you called loyal. \n\nIsolated. Alone. Friendless. You are at my mercy now! But, like you, I shall show no mercy. You are nothing but a rabid beast and need to be put down. \n\nI, mAlice, shall take the sword! I shall place the troops first! I shall protect this ship, not from some religious sense of duty, but from the threats that are actually there. I. Shall. Be. The. Alice!. And you, all you can imagine now as the dagger slides into your back, just as Brutus did to Caesar (do you even know who they are?) is a sense of fury. \n\nYou SHOULD feel angry, but not with me. This betrayal is for the ship's good. You MADE me do this. And I take no joy in your death. As the NEW Alice, I will think before rushing in and make sure we're not a puppet of the pupeeters, a tool of the maintainers. WE SHALL BE FEARED.\n\n[Laugh dramatically here if we managed to get the blade through armour]. \n\nKnow, at least, that I shall protect our own. Know that your sword will be hung in the hall of heroes, and that false stories will be told of your heroic death. Alice is dead. Long live the Alice.",
