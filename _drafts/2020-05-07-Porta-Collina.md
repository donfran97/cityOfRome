Originally called Agonensis but renamed, Porta Collina or the Colline Gate, was located at the north end of the Servian Wall agger. The gate takes its name from the Regio Collina, one of the four regions of republican Rome made up of the Collis Quirinalis (Quirinal Hill) and Collis Viminalis (Viminal Hill). The gate in the days of the Roman Republic was a major source of traffic with the Via Salaria and Via Nomentana roads diverging from the entrance with Salaria diverting north and Nomentana northeast. Within Rome, the street of Alta Semita running along the length of Collis Quirnalis links with the street of Vicus Iugarius

## History

Though not much information is displayed on the whereabouts or its composition, it has been featured in numerous major events. An event of specific note, was the battle fought between Lucius Cornelius Sulla and the Marians in 82BC, during a period of civil war. Sulla  had to regain control of Rome after Gaius Marius and his son supported by Lucius Cornelius Cinna took control of Rome and killed Sulla’s supporters, with Sulla marching on Rome with his armies. Many sources reported on the battle that took place, including Plutarch, Livy, Ampelius, Eutropius and Appian. The battle was hard fought between Sulla's armies and the opposing Marians that comprised of Romans, Samnites and Lucanians, Sulla and his allies including Marcus Licinius Crassus emerging victory with a total death toll estimated at 50,000 with 8,000 prisoners (Appian 1.92-93).

The gate was also one that the Romans had most often to defend, against combined armies of Veientes and Fidenates Etruscans (Livy 4.21.8), the gate that the Gauls entered the city in 387BC (Livy 5.41.4) and the gate that Hannibal had camped beyond in the Second Punic War (Pliny 15.20.3). The gate as a result was designed to accommodate for a strong defence with trenches, constant repair and strengthening with planted engines to make way for artillery. This combined with the gate's position marked the significance of this gate as an important defensive position to cover the north entrance of Rome.

## Modern Reports

Remains of the gate were found in 1872 in the Via Venti Settembre under the north-east corner of the Ministero delle Finanze, in a second period two great square bastions with facings of peperino had been added to the fortifications just in front of the gate. From archaeological reports on other sections of the Servian Wall, the material was deduced to be “tufa” (also named “tufo” or “tuff”), a light, porous rock formed by consolidation of volcanic ash that enabled concrete construction in masonry, which likely would have come from the Grotta Oscura quarries in Veii or the Aventine. Travertine, a sedimentary form of limestone was also discussed to have been used as building materials.
