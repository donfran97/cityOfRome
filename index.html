<p>The MQ City of Rome Blog focuses on the history of ancient Rome. The city was founded in myth in the year 753 BCE and became the first metropolis, with an empire stretching from Scotland to the Sahara and from the Atlantic Ocean to the Euphrates (Iraq).</p>

<p>This semester's blog explores many fascinating topics about Ancient Rome including: the Pantheon, Roman Real Estate Moguls, Temples, and the Rock (not actually the people's champion). For more ancient insights, consult the oracle at Delphi, or just read the blog posts below.</p>

<p>Just like Netflix, the editors of Macquarie Session 2 2019, have published a fine selection of blogs for your binge-reading pleasure. Each post has been created by a student at Macquarie University as part of their research undertaken under the direction of Professor Ray Laurence in the Department of Ancient History (in AHIS 313).

<p>All topics for the posts were picked by students and researched by students with some guidance. The content of the posts devised by students studying the City of Rome was then edited by student <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/study/why-study-here/employability/learning-for-life">Professional and Community Engagement (PACE AHIS 392)</a> interns to create the final versions of the posts that appear here. The students developed their own view of Rome through these topics. Expect to find some lively ideas, even some puns (good or bad), and a shift away from the formalities of academic writing to make the study of the city of Rome accessible to a wider public.</p>

<p>Leading on from this, while these posts contain some material that is inaccessible to the wider public or teachers of HSC Ancient History in New South Wales, because it is hidden behind a paywall, they are all hyperlinked to open access translations of ancient sources and, where possible, to further information. This was done to enable teachers and students (and anyone else reading this blog) to dig deeper into the history of ancient Rome.</p>
</div>

<p>Despite dealing with strict lockdown procedures put in place in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 team, consisting of Dominique, Jackson and Nathan, were able to continue along the path of preceding researchers and published a set of posts focusing on the gates of the Servian Wall. Below you will find the entries which bring to light the diverse and fascinating history of the Esquiline, Carmentalis, and Colline gates. These entries have been written with intent of condensing the various accounts and perspectives of the gates scattered across a range of modern and ancient sources into singular stories which will ensnare the interest of both the average reader and aficionados of Roman history. </p>

    <p>Dominique Bezzina is a penultimate Archaeology student majoring in geophysics at Macquarie University. As a part of her PACE internship, she is working under Ray Laurence to generate content for the MQ City of Rome Blog. Dominique has a keen interest in understanding how past humans interacted with their environment and studying the ancient remains of that relationship.</p>
    <p>Jackson Dehring is a student at Macquarie University in the final semester of studying his Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Modern History. Jackson is currently working under Ray Laurence through the PACE program offered at Macquarie. Enamoured by the history and myths of the Greco-Romans at a young age, Jackson has come to widen his historical focus through a geopolitical lense, and is intrigued by ancient state formation and policy.</p>
    <p>Nathan Tsang is a student at Macquarie University studying a Bachelor of Ancient History majoring in Greece, Rome and Late Antiquity. Although initially interested in the Romans at a young age, his interests shifted during the HSC to the Greek city-state of Sparta being fascinated by the popularity and culture of the ancient nation.</p>

    <p>Caitlin Dickson is a PACE intern working under Professor Ray Laurence. She is an undergraduate student at Macquarie University studying a Bachelor of Archaeology, but her day job is working as a producer for the ABC. Caitlin has a keen interest in the deep past with a minor in geology and also loves society and culture, with a major in anthropology. She hopes to combine her media skills with her archaeology degree to help make documentaries - or to one day embark on a master's degree.</p>
    <p>Jennifer Oliveri is a PACE intern working under Professor Ray Laurence. She is an undergraduate student at Macquarie University studying a Bachelor of Ancient History with a particular interest in Ancient philosophy and languages. After graduating she plans on studying teaching. </p>
    <p>Oliver Stack is an undergraduate student studying a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Modern and Ancient History. He has from a very young age enjoyed history and as a result commenced the above degree after high school. He has decided against taking a formal education in history any further, as he is moving into a Bachelor of Laws next year. He has very much enjoyed a focus on Republican Rome, Late Antiquity and Europe in the 20th century.</p>
    <p>Chi Yam is a student at Macquarie University studying a Bachelor in Ancient History majoring in Egypt and the Near East, and a PACE student on the City of Rome Project. He enjoys long walks on the beach and rolling dice.</p>
    <p>Ray Laurence is Professor of Ancient History. Prior to his appointment at Macquarie in 2017, he held positions at the Universities of Reading, Birmingham and Kent in the UK. His research is centred on the study of Roman Urbanism. He also works on the study of childhood and ageing in antiquity, as well as roads and communications technologies in the Roman Empire.
  Ray's work often involves the use of innovative techniques, whether drawn from approaches in the Digital Humanities or in Archaeological Science. He has also developed collaborative projects with animators and an animation studio to produce six films, which have been viewed more than 8 million times. He is the editor of the series Studies in Roman Space and Urbanism (Routledge).</p>

  <p>Ewan Coopey is a PACE intern working under Professor Ray Laurence. He is an undergraduate student at Macquarie University studying a Bachelor of Ancient History with a focus on Republican Rome and the Early Principate. His passion for all things ancient and medieval arose in childhood, when he would wander through the Roman forts and medieval castles scattered across the British Isles. His research interests include: Ancient Roman religion, cultural transmission within the Empire, Roman auxiliaries, identity in the ancient world, and the province of Dalmatia.</p>
  <p>Jack Jones is a PACE intern working under Professor Ray Laurence. He is an undergraduate student at Macquarie University studying a Bachelor of Archaeology, with a double major in geology and palaeobiology. While not intending to do further studies in the ancient world, Jack has always been intersted in history, resulting from the Horrible Histories books he read as a child. However, Jack is more interested in slighlty more ancient pre-human history. Jacks research interests include: life during the Ediacaran, future technologies for the study of palaeobiology and linking stratigraphy to fossil appearances.</p>
  <p>Oliver Twyford is a PACE intern working under Professor Ray Laurence. He is an undergraduate student at Macquarie University studying a Bachelor of Ancient History, after which he hopes to progress to postgraduate Classical studies. Oliver has always held a keen interest in humanity's past, reading many fictional and non-fictional historical novels from an early age. However, it was after his travels to the ancient ruins of Europe, in particular, that he wanted to make history more than a hobby. Oliver's research interests include: the late Roman Republic to early Principate, the impact of the Roman conquer of Britain, Spartan culture and ideology, and the evolution of humanity from hunter-gatherers to city-states and nations.</p>
