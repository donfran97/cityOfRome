#### _An entryway marked by a bloody period in the closing years of the Roman Republic, marred with constant war_

## Setting and Scenery

Originally called Agonensis but renamed, Porta Collina or the Colline Gate was located at the north end of the Servian Wall _agger_ ([Dionys. 9.68](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/9C*.html#68.3)). The gate takes its name from the _Regio Collina_, one of the four regions of republican Rome made up of the _Collis Quirinalis_ (Quirinal Hill) and _Collis Viminalis_ (Viminal Hill). The gate in the days of the Roman Republic was a major source of traffic with the _Via Salaria_ and _Via Nomentana_ roads diverging from the entrance with Salaria diverting north and Nomentana northeast. Within Rome, the street of _Alta Semita_ running along the length of _Collis Quirnalis_ links with the street of _Vicus Iugarius_.

The gate was constructed as part of the Servian Wall designed to encircle Rome as an exterior defence. The Wall was supposedly constructed by King Servius Tullius who ruled from 578-535BC, the dates inconsistent between 4th-2nd Centuries BC. In modern day Italy, many of the gates' remains can be found throughout the city.

## Memories of Rome

The Colline Gate in the days of the Roman Republic was featured in numerous major events. The most publicised event of note, was the battle fought between Lucius Cornelius Sulla and the Marians in 82BC, during a period of civil war. Sulla  had to regain control of Rome after Gaius Marius and his son supported by Lucius Cornelius Cinna took control of Rome and killed Sullaâ€™s supporters, with Sulla marching on Rome with his armies (Malden, 1886). Many sources reported on the battle that took place, including Plutarch, Livy, Ampelius, Eutropius and Appian. The battle was hard fought between Sulla's armies and the opposing Marians that comprised of Romans, Samnites and Lucanians, with Sulla and his allies including Marcus Licinius Crassus emerging victory with a total death toll estimated at 50,000 with 8,000 prisoners ([Appian 1.92-93](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#93)). The aftermath of the battle ended with Sulla executing Marius' supporters and Marius himself committing suicide, cementing Sulla's status as the dictator of Rome until his death in 78BC.

The gate was also one that the Romans used often against incoming invaders. Ancient sources recount regard the gate being used against the combined armies of Veientes and Fidenates Etruscans from the north ([Livy 4.21.8](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0026%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D21)), the gate that Hannibal had camped beyond in the Second Punic War ([Pliny 15.20.3](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D15%3Achapter%3D20)) and the gate which the Gauls entered Rome in 390BC sacking the city ([Livy 5.41](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0026%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D41)). The gate as a result was designed to accommodate for a strong defence with trenches, constant repair and strengthening with planted engines to make way for artillery (Frank, 1918). This combined with the gate's position marked the significance of this gate as an important defensive position to cover the north entrance of Rome against invaders from the Mediterranean.

The gate also had a minor significance in religion with Plutarch recounting the punishment for a Vestal Virgin breaking her vow of chastity. The punishment was severe through being buried alive near the Colline Gate ([Plut. Numa 10](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Numa*.html#10.4)). Overall the Colline Gate, though not being significant to the other gates of the Servian Wall, still held its own relevance as a strategic defensive position to cover Rome's northern part of the _agger_. Its linkage with the _Via Salaria_ and _Via Nomentana_ emphasises the gate as an entryway for trade routes as Salaria was used by the Sabines to take salt from the marshes at the mouth of the Tiber River ([Platner and Ashby, 1929](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Via_Salaria.html)).

## Modern Reports

Remains of the gate were found in 1872 in the Via Venti Settembre street under the north-east corner of the Ministero delle Finanze (Ministry of Finance), in a second period two great square bastions with facings of _peperino_ volcanic, had been added to the fortifications just in front where the gate stood (Richardson, 1992). From archaeological reports on other sections of the Servian Wall, most of the material was, including that of the Colline was deduced to be _tufa_ (also named _tufo_ or _tuff_), a light, porous rock formed by consolidation of volcanic ash that enabled concrete construction in masonry, which likely would have come from the _Grotta Oscura_ quarries in Veii or the Aventine (Frank, 1918). Travertine, a sedimentary form of limestone was also discussed to have been used as building materials.
